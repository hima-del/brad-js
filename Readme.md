**Try and Catch**
* The try statement : test a block of code for errors.
* The catch statement : handle the error.
* The throw statement : create custom errors.
* The finally statement : execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.

**Instance of operator**
* The instanceof operator tests whether the prototype property of a constructor appears anywhere in the prototype chain of an object.
