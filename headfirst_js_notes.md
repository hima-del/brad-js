 **What exactly is a block of code?**

* Syntactically, a block of code is a set of statements, which could be one statement,or as many as you like, grouped togetherbetween curly braces.
* Once youâ€™ve got a block of code, all the statements in that block are treated as a group to be executed together. 
* For instance, all the statements within the block in a while statement are executed if the condition of the while is true.
* The same holds for a block in an if or else if.

**= Vs == VS === in JavaScript**

* = is used for assigning values to a variable.
* == is used for comparing two variables, but it ignores the datatype of variable.
* === is used for comparing two variables, but this operator also checks datatype and compares two values.
* = is called as assignment operator
* == and === are called as comparison operators. 
* = does not return true or false.
* == Return true only if the two operands are equal.
* === returns true only if both values and data types are the same for the two variables.
