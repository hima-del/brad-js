 **What exactly is a block of code?**

* Syntactically, a block of code is a set of statements, which could be one statement,or as many as you like, grouped togetherbetween curly braces.
* Once youâ€™ve got a block of code, all the statements in that block are treated as a group to be executed together. 
* For instance, all the statements within the block in a while statement are executed if the condition of the while is true.
* The same holds for a block in an if or else if.
